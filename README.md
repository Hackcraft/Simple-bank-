# Simple-bank-
This addon is a simple banking addon which allows you to hook up a bank robbery addon to it for a more realistic experience as players will be stealing money from other players! (It was made to work with BankRS which is on the workshop but that requires some tweaking to get it to work).

If you want to set it up with this amazing bank robbery addon (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=389445061) then you'll need to replace the init.lua found in \lua\entities\bank_vault in that addon with the one provided on the github!
